    <h2>Nice scenario simulation</h2>
    <p>We simulate the Nice scenario of the early solar system evolution.</p>
    <p>In the video <a href="#vid-td-bodycentric">below</a>, we show a successful simulation. The five planets are Jupiter, Saturn, and three ice giants from inside out, orbits shown by the circles. The ice planets are all of 16? Earth masses. The planets have been migrated into successive 3:2 mean motion resonances before this simulation. The planetesimal disk is composed of 1000 equal mass particles, totalling 35 Earth masses; and their mutual interaction is omitted.</p>
