    <h2>Tidal disruption of an asteroid</h2>
    <p>We simulate the tidal disruption of an asteroid close to a white dwarf (WD). </p>
    <p>The asteroid is modelled as a rubble pile of 8000 equal-size hard sphere particles. The interactions between the particles are gravity and inelastic collisions and the asteroid is assembled by letting its constituent particles fall freely. The asteroid radius is about 12 km with a bulk density of 2 g/cm^3. The WD is a point mass of 0.75 solar masses. The nominal tidal disruption distance is about 0.06 au.</p>
    <p>The asteroid's orbit before the disruption is such that the pericentre and apocentre distances are 0.04 and 10 au, respectively. The initial distance between the WD and the asteroid is 0.1 au and system is tracked for 50 days.</p>
    <p>Video <a href="#vid-td-bodycentric">one</a> shows the tidal disruption of the asteroid in a frame centred on the it. The video title shows the time since the start of the simulation, distance from the mass centre of the asteroid to the WD, and the normalised particle collision intensity (that records the number of particle mutual collisions in a time interval). The x- and y-axes show the position of the particle in the orbital plane and have the same scale. The colours show the initial distance from a particle to the centre of mass of the asteroid. The arrow points toward the WD.</p>
