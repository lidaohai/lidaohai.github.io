      <li><h3>白矮星吸积重元素/Accretion of metals by white dwarfs</h3>
        <p>Most stars become white dwarfs (WDs) when they run out of fuel. Those WDs often show metal lines in their spectra. However, those heavy elements should sink rather quickly in an WD's atmosphere because of the extreme gravity. Therefore, it is believed that ongoing infall of asteroidal material is the cause.</p>
        <p>Our Sun is to become a WD in several Gyr. Using numerical simulations, we have studied the absorption of main belt asteroids, Jovian trojan asteroids and trans-Neptunian objects on to the solar WD. We find that trans-Neptunian objects dominate the long-term Gyr-timescale accretion and the rate agrees well with the observed old WDs.</p>
        <p>We have also studied the details of accretion of a single asteroid onto the WD.</p>

          <li><h4>海王星卫星系统/The Neptunian satellite system</h4>
            <p>Neptune has a peculiar satellite system. Triton is a large moon, revolving around Neptune in a direction opposite to the spin of the host planet. Another moon, Nereid is characterised by the most elongated orbit among all known moons. We aim to explain the origin of the two moons and embed our model in the Nice scenario.</p>
            <p>The Nice scenario scenario postulates that the solar system's giant planets have interacted with an outer massive planetesimal disk and have radially migrated long distances to their current orbits. In the video below, we show a simulation of the Nice scenario. The five circles represent the orbits of five giant planets and the grey points denote the planetesimals. Notably, there is an instability period at the end of which the black planet is ejected, as a result of series of scatterings with other planets including Neptune. We study the implications on the satellite system of such a scattering between Neptune and that then-ejected planet.</p>

            <p>In our first model, the two moons are formed around Neptune and the encounter flips the orbit of Triton and Nereid's is elongated. Then collisions and tides later fully evolve the system to the observed one over Gyr timescale. see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159..184L/abstract">this work</a> for full details.</p>
            <p>In our second model, the two moons are formed around the then-ejected planet. During the encounter between that planet and Neptune, the two moons are captured by Neptune. This model features a high success rate ~10%. see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...638A.139L/abstract">this work</a> for full details.</p>

          <li><h4>木卫六族群的演化/The Himalia satellite family of Jupiter</h4>
            <p>About 200 natural satellites have been found in the solar system. Most of those satellites reside around the four giant planets. Those satellites show clustered distributions. Each cluster/family consists fragments of the same collisional event of the same parent body. Notably, a family at Jupiter, with the largest member Himalia, is special in that its member distribution is not consistent with that from a collision. Here we study two factors that may be responsible for the dispersion.</p>
            <p>First, we show that Himalia, though only ~80 km in radius, could exert a significant local effect on other family members. We have designed a semi-analytical approach and found a network of secular resonances. When in resonance, Himalia locks the phase angle of another member. These resonances are confirmed in N-body simulations. For details, see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016CeMDA.125..133L/abstract">this work</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017CeMDA.129....1L/abstract">that work</a>. However, the timescale of these resonances is relatively short ~Myr. In order to study the long-term effects of Himalia, we have carried out Gyr simulations, paying close attention to how much Himalia scatters its family. It turns out that the resulting diffusion, while pronounced, is not sufficient to account for the observation; see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018Icar..310...77L/abstract">this work</a>. These imply that external factors are probably at work.</p>
            <p>Then as we discussed <a href="#vid-nice">above</a>, during the early solar system evolution, numerous planetesimals and likely, also planets, flew by Jupiter. We have performed numerical simulations testing the effects of the flybys by planetesimals and planets on a primordial Himalia family and found that the planetary encounters readily cause the observed distribution.

      <li><h3>星团中的行星系统/Stellar flyby encounters in open clusters</h3>
        <p>Most stars are born in large molecular clouds, together with many others, as often referred to as star clusters. As a consequence, these stars, together with their planets, are subject to frequent flybys by their sibling stars.</p>
        <p>Using extended N-body simulation, We study how the Solar system and typical extra-solar planetary systems react to the flybys. We find that the planets may be ejected, becoming a stray planet without a host star or it can be grabbed by the intruding star. The interplanetary forcing also plays an important role and has to do with the system's long-term evolution after the encounter. See <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.488.1366L/abstract">this work</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1149L/abstract">that work</a> for details.</p>
        <p>However, the above works have only considered flybys of single stars whereas in actual clusters, probably more than half of the members each contains two stars on bound orbits. How these binaries change the picture when they are considered? Generally, the disturbance a planetary system receives is boosted by a factor of at least several; see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.1212L/abstract">this work</a> for details.</p>

      <li><h3>限制性三体问题/The restricted three body problem</h3>
        <p>The (restricted) three body is well known to be have no closed-form solution. Here we study a special case where a massless test particle revolves around a massive binary analytically. By expanding the Hamiltonian that describes the particle's orbital evolution the using small quantities, we approximate the long-term behaviour of its eccentricity and inclination.
