      <li><h3>Accretion of metals by white dwarfs</h3>
        <p>Most stars become white dwarfs (WDs) when they run out of fuel. Those WDs often show metal lines in their spectra. However, those heavy elements should sink rather quickly in an WD's atmosphere because of the extreme gravity. Therefore, it is believed that ongoing infall of asteroidal material is the cause.</p>
        <p>Our Sun is to become a WD in several Gyr. Using numerical simulations, we have studied the absorption of main belt asteroids, Jovian trojan asteroids and trans-Neptunian objects on to the solar WD. We find that trans-Neptunian objects dominate the long-term Gyr-timescale accretion and the rate agrees well with the observed old WDs.</p>
        <p>We have also studied the details of accretion of a single asteroid onto the WD.</p>

      <li><h3>Dynamics of natural satellites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><h4>The Neptunian satellite system</h4>
            <p>Neptune has a peculiar satellite system. Triton is a large moon, revolving around Neptune in a direction opposite to the spin of the host planet. Another moon, Nereid is characterised by the most elongated orbit among all known moons. We aim to explain the origin of the two moons and embed our model in the Nice scenario.</p>
            <p>The Nice scenario scenario postulates that the solar system's giant planets have interacted with an outer massive planetesimal disk and have radially migrated long distances to their current orbits. In the video below, we show a simulation of the Nice scenario. The five circles represent the orbits of five giant planets and the grey points denote the planetesimals. Notably, there is an instability period at the end of which the black planet is ejected, as a result of series of scatterings with other planets including Neptune. We study the implications on the satellite system of such a scattering between Neptune and that then-ejected planet.</p>

            <p>In our first model, the two moons are formed around Neptune and the encounter flips the orbit of Triton and Nereid's is elongated. Then collisions and tides later fully evolve the system to the observed one over Gyr timescale. see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159..184L/abstract">this work</a> for full details.</p>
            <p>In our second model, the two moons are formed around the then-ejected planet. During the encounter between that planet and Neptune, the two moons are captured by Neptune. This model features a high success rate ~10%. see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...638A.139L/abstract">this work</a> for full details.</p>

          <li><h4>The Himalia satellite family of Jupiter</h4>
            <p>About 200 natural satellites have been found in the solar system. Most of those satellites reside around the four giant planets and in the figure on the right, we show their orbital elements (data taken from <a href="https://sites.google.com/carnegiescience.edu/sheppard/moons">Scott Sheppard</a>). The x-axis show the size of the orbit and the lower-y the extent of elongation and upper-y the tilt. Those satellites show clustered distributions. Each cluster/family consists fragments of the same collisional event of the same parent body.</p>
            <p>Notably, a family at Jupiter, with the largest member Himalia, is special in that its member distribution is not consistent with that from a collision. Here we study two factors that may or may not be responsible for the dispersion.</p>
            <p>First, we show that Himalia, though only ~80 km in radius, could exert a significant local effect on other family members. We have designed a semi-analytical approach and found a network of secular resonances. When in resonance, Himalia locks the phase angle of another member. These resonances are confirmed in N-body simulations. For details, see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016CeMDA.125..133L/abstract">this work</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017CeMDA.129....1L/abstract">that work</a>. However, the timescale of these resonances is relatively short ~Myr. In order to study the long-term effects of Himalia, we have carried out Gyr simulations, paying close attention to how much Himalia scatters its family. It turns out that the resulting diffusion, while pronounced, is not sufficient to account for the observation; see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018Icar..310...77L/abstract">this work</a>. These imply that external factors are probably at work.</p>
            <p>Then as we discussed <a href="#vid-nice">above</a>, during the early solar system evolution, numerous planetesimals and likely, also planets, flew by Jupiter. We have performed numerical simulations testing the effects of the flybys by planetesimals and planets on a primordial Himalia family and found that the planetary encounters readily cause the observed distribution. See <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017AJ....154..209L/abstract">this work</a> for details.</p>

      <li><h3>Stellar flyby encounters in open clusters</h3>
        <p>Most stars are born in large molecular clouds, together with many others, as often referred to as star clusters. Shown on the right is the Pleiades cluster (Image credit: NASA, ESA and AURA/Caltech) composed of ~1000 of stars. As a consequence, these stars, together with their planets, are subject to frequent flybys by their sibling stars.</p>
        <p>Using extended N-body simulation, We study how the Solar system and typical extra-solar planetary systems react to the flybys. We find that the planets may be ejected, becoming a stray planet without a host star or it can be grabbed by the intruding star. The interplanetary forcing also plays an important role and has to do with the system's long-term evolution after the encounter. See <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.488.1366L/abstract">this work</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1149L/abstract">that work</a> for details.</p>
        <p>However, the above works have only considered flybys of single stars whereas in actual clusters, probably more than half of the members each contains two stars on bound orbits. How these binaries change the picture when they are considered? Generally, the disturbance a planetary system receives is boosted by a factor of at least several; see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.1212L/abstract">this work</a> for details.</p>

      <li><h3>The restricted three body problem</h3>
        <p>The term "two-body problem" refers to the case where two celestial bodies as point masses are moving in isolation under the Newtonian universal gravitational forces. This two body can be analytically solved. But if three bodies are present, no general solution exist. So here we tackle a special case where two bodies are orbiting each other on a trajectory as prescribed by the two-body problem; the third body is massless and feels the gravity from the other two body but not vice versa; furthermore, this third body is farther.</p>
        <p>We have studied this problem analytically using classical perturbation theory. On the right, we show the phase space structure for a highly-inclined outer orbit; here the \(x\)-axis \(\theta_2\) is an angle while the \(y\)-axis \(e_2\) is the orbital eccentricity of the outer body. We observe that there is a resonance at \(\theta_2=270^\circ\) in that the angle librates around that value. The green points are from accompanying numerical simulations and agree with the red points from our derivations qualitatively. See <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014MNRAS.437.3832L/abstract">this work</a> for details.</p>
